=======================
Stock Delivery Internal
=======================

This module adds the concept of an internal delivery carrier to `delivery
.carrier`. When the `delivery_type` of a carrier is set to `Internal`, any
pickings shipped from that carrier will create `Requests For Pickup`. These
requests for pickup will in-turn create two pickings, one for the carrier to
pick up and one for the buyer to receive.

The Requests for pickup can also be configured to allow for Cash On
Delivery. Choosing this method will create two more pickings for the cash
pickup and subsequent delivery.



Usage
=====

To use, simply add a Delivery Carrier with the Type set to Internal.
