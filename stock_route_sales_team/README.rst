Stock Route Sales Teams
=======================

Allows to configure a Route according to a sales team.

 * An option on the Routes defines if the route can be used on sales
   teams or not
 * A new option on a sales team allows to choose the Route to use
   for their sales (the procurements will use this route, except if
   another one has been set on the lines)
