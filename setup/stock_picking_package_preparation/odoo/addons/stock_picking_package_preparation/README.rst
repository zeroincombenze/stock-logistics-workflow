Stock Picking Package Preparation
=================================

This module adds a new document in the Warehouse menu: **Package
Preparation**. It works on a selection of pickings and allows to add
them all in the same package, then to transfer all the pickings at once.

A possible use case is to put all the selected pickings on a pallet.
