Stock Ownership By Move
=======================

This module lets you use the ownership in each move of a picking when receiving
shipments. All other stock functionalities already use the owner in the move,
and not the one in the picking.

Installation
------------





Configuration
-------------






Installing this module, the setting to show owners will be enabled
automatically.

Usage
-----







=====

- In a picking, you can set the owner on every line.
- When transferring a picking, lines with different owners will not be grouped.
- In the transfer details wizard, the owner of every line can be changed.
- After the transfer, the owner is also shown in the Operations tab.
- Generated quants have the selected owner.
- The "Owner" field is not shown anymore in the picking.

Known Issues / Roadmap

- Show the owner also in the form and tree views of the move when not inside
  a picking.
- The "Owner" field in the move form view inside the picking is already added
  in the module stock_ownership_availability_rules. It could be added here
  instead.
- Check what happens when using the barcode interface.
- The original method tries to respect the order of moves when generating pack
  operations. We don't, because we use a dictionary which is unordered.
