Delivery Orders Mass Assign

This module allows to help checking the availability of delivery orders:

* A wizard which allows on multiple delivery orders at a time to:
    * check availability of Delivery Orders;
    * force availability of Delivery Orders;
    * process Pickings (deliver);

* A scheduled action to check availability of all the delivery orders.
  It is not active by default.

This may be necessary for those who want to check the availability
more often than running the procurement scheduler.
